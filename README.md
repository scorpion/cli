## Rust

Rust is a multi-paradigm programming language focused on performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. Rust is syntactically similar to C++, and provides memory safety without using garbage collection.

We recommend starting with the [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)

## Crates

Cargo is the Rust package manager. Cargo downloads your Rust package’s dependencies, compiles your packages, makes distributable packages, and uploads them to [crates.io](https://crates.io), the Rust community’s package registry.

For more information, please see the official [crates.io scopion package](https://crates.io/crates/scorpion).
